In short, this keyboard layout has all the good traits of US-international
without it's bad ones.
Estonian layout is not suitable for coding because it requires AltGr to be
used for common characters like {}[]<>, and well, most of the characters are
in uncomfortable places. But when writing Estonian text I need characters 
õäöü, which US-international allows me to make, but it has dead keys for that.
This is a keyboard layout that makes it easy to code, and write Estonian
characters without needing to switch between Estonian and US layouts.
